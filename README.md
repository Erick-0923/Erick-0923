# 👋 Hi, I'm an Innovative Engineer

## 🚀 I'm a passionate AI/ML Engineer, Blockchain Developer, and Full-Stack Engineer.
-💻 Languages I use daily: Python, Go, JavaScript, typeScript, php, Rust, and more.
-🧠 I'm especially interested in Machine Learning — with a focus on Deep Learning and real-world AI applications.
-🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on innovative deep learning teams and forward-thinking tech projects.

##💬 My Engineering Philosophy:
❤️ You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.
❤️ Beautiful is better than ugly.
❤️ Simple is better than complex.
❤️ Readability counts.
❤️ Errors should never pass silently.
❤️ Now is better than never.
❤️ An algorithm must be seen to be believed.

Adapted from The Zen of Python — and principles I live by.
